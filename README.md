# GreenChats

This is a blogging application with which I intend to experiment
with secure web design methods. This project will allow users to create blogs of their own, not unlike
FaceBook or LinkedIn. My resume and stuff about me will be the stuff for my page. I'm
going to have to redo the HTML, this could take a while. First off: new template.

Structure:
Templating is accomplished with EJS rendering.

### Accounts (in progress)
This directory contains routing and handlers for managing accounts, such as
editing information and deleting an account.

### Registration (in progress)
This directory contains functionality for creating an account. Future: may be merged
with the Accounts directory.

### To Do:

* Restart project using good design principles learned in the Senior Design
project that uses Django.
* Test new version against OWASP Top 10 one by one.
* Learn to encrypt passwords
