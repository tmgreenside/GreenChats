# GreenChats

This is a blogging application with which I intend to experiment
with secure web design methods. This project will allow users to create blogs
of their own, not unlike FaceBook or LinkedIn.

Structure:
Templating is accomplished with EJS rendering.

### Admin (not started)
This section will contain functions for an administrator to review materials on
standard accounts, including a section to delete or alter data.

### Accounts (in progress)
This directory contains routing and handlers for managing accounts, such as
editing information and deleting an account.

### Registration (in progress)
This directory contains functionality for creating an account. Future: may be merged
with the Accounts directory.

### To Do:

* Restart project using good design principles learned in the Senior Design
project that uses Django.
* Test new version against OWASP Top 10 one by one.
* Learn to encrypt passwords.
