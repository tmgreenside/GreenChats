#GreenChats

This is a blogging application with which I intend to experiment
with secure web design methods. This project will allow users to create blogs of their own, not unlike
FaceBook or LinkedIn. My resume and stuff about me will be the stuff for my page. I'm

Structure:
Templating is accomplished with EJS rendering.

To Do:
<ul>
