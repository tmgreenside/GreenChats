GreenChats

This is a blogging application with which I intend to experiment
with secure web design methods. This project will allow users to create blogs of their own, not unlike
FaceBook or LinkedIn. My resume and stuff about me will be the stuff for my page. I'm
going to have to redo the HTML, this could take a while. First off: new template.

Structure:
Templating is accomplished with EJS rendering.

To Do:
<ul>
<li>retrieving and displaying data for user's profile</li>
<li>viewing other user's profiles</li>
<li>search bar showing results as the user types a query</li>
<li>Cryptography for handling passwords. According to <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html">this</a>,
NGINX should handle the encryption between client and server.</li>
<li>For the Friends page, experiment with Ajax to populate results without reloading the page. Reference
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajax-request">this</a>.
</ul>
